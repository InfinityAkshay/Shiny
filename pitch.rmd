## Introduction

- This app demonstrates the relationship between car weight (in lbs) and mileage (in mpg).
- Built using the `mtcars` dataset and a linear regression model.
- Predicts mileage based on user-provided car weight.


## Dataset: mtcars

- The `mtcars` dataset is a built-in R dataset.
- Contains data on 32 car models, including:
  - Weight (`wt`) in 1000s of lbs.
  - Mileage (`mpg`) in miles per gallon.
- Used to build a regression model for prediction.


## App Functionality

- **Input:** User enters car weight (lbs).
- **Output:**
  - Regression plot with data points, regression line, and predicted point.
  - Predicted mileage displayed below the plot.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Conclusion

- This app provides an intuitive way to explore the relationship between car weight and mileage.
- Demonstrates the power of regression modeling in data analysis.
- Try it yourself and predict mileage for different car weights!
